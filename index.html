				<h2>Correlations Discovered Between smoking, access to healthcare and poverty.</h2>
				<p>A recent study examining US residents and the links between smoking, poverty and access to healthcare
					uncovered some surprising results.
				</p>
	  
				<p>The assumption that states with higher a percerntage of residents with access to healthcare would have lower rates of smoking was disproven.  
					In fact, a graph charting states with the percentage of residents with access to healthcare and smoking rates revealed
					there may be a small positive correlation between the two.  This demonstrates that states with higher percentages of residents with access to healthcare
					also have a slightly larger percentage of the population that smokes.  Though perhaps the positive difference isn't statistically significant,
					it is clear there is not a negagive correlation, meaning the original assumption is incorrect. </p>
	  
				<p>Perhaps less surprising is that there is a stronger positive correlation between the percentage of residents living in poverty
					and the % of state residents that smoke.  Smoking is a form of stress relief (among other possible uses), and poverty
					- along with other stressors associated with being poor - creates high levels of stress.  A linear regression could be utlized to
					determine the extent to which these factors are positively correlated.
